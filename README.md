This site was build in the "React Courses and Tutorial" on udemy. It taught me how to use React Hooks and gave me deeper knowledge of React.js. This is a tech store featuring vintage phones, computers, and radios. It allows you to search through the products by name, sort by category or price and tells you which products gives you free shipping. It also features a login, cart, and checkout page. It's connected to Strapi and Stripe to make it a fully functioning test site.
